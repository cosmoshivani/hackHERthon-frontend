            Safety shouldn’t come with barriers.
            That’s why we’re here to help remove them.

            <h2>
            One billion people, 15 &percnt; of the world's population, experience some form of disability.
            </h2>
            <h4>
            In the event of a crisis or disaster, people with disabilities are more likely to be left behind.

            Evac-Ability aims to knock down the barriers that block people with disabilities from accessing 
            their right to safety. We spoke to real people - from the mother of a non-speaking autistic child, 
            to a young adult with sensory and mobility issues. They wanted a way to access relevant, 
            reliable safety information during times of crisis.
    
            </h5>
            <p>
            We connect people with disabilities to the information they need, right where they are:
            </p>
            <p>
            Nearby emergency shelters Accessible restroom locations Food pantries/distribution Delivery of medicines, 
            medical equipment, vitamins, and hygiene products
    
            </p>
            <h3>
            Some people are have difficulty accessing essential resources because of their disability.
